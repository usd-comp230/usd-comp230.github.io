# COMP 230: Advanced Computational Problem Modeling

Welcome to COMP 230 - Advanced Computational Modeling! This semester we will be diving into advanced data structures (e.g. graphs, priority queues, quad trees, etc.) from the perspective of solving advanced computational problems! Before we begin, please read the syllabus and take the survey for me to get to know you better and help make paired programming pairs.  Note the course schedule and your responsibilities for the semester. It is important to consider your other responsibilities this semester and if this course aligns with your whole course load. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out.

## Course Overview
This course will introduce programming concepts and logical thinking that will be useful no matter your chosen profession. At the end of this course you should be able to:

1. Develop a repertoire of problem-solving techniques that emphasize abstraction, modularity and efficiency
2. Identify, use, and implement some of the important abstract data types for data management operations
3. Perform algorithm complexity analysis
4. Apply advanced data structures and algorithms to solve various problems

_This course draws on ideas and material from Dr. Jiang's version of COMP 230, Dr. Gibbs Politz's CSE 12 at UCSD and UCSD's CSE 100 course._
